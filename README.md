# Marble Game 
The Marble Game is a turn-based game between a player and the computer. Both start with 5 marbles each, and the goal is to be the first to collect all 10 marbles. 

Players take turns either:
1. Hiding a number of marbles while the opponent tries to guess if it’s odd or even.
2. Guess whether the opponent’s hidden number of marbles is odd or even.

The game continues until one player claims all 10 marbles.
